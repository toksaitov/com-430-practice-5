# COM 430, Software Engineering
## Practice Task #5, Linear History in Git (Branching vs Rebasing)

### Requirements

Recall the [Practice #2](https://github.com/auca/com.421-430/blob/master/Practice_Tasks/Practice_02.md) task from the previous course. You were practicing doing branching and merging in that task. In this repository you have an unfinished solution up to **step 5** with an unmerged `dev` branch. This time, you will have to maintain a linear history by using rebasing instead of merging.

1. Clone the repository to a system with Gradle and JDK installed.

2. Merge the `dev` branch into `master` without creating a merge commit. Think how can you do that.

3. Redo coding assignments from [Practice #2](https://github.com/auca/com.421-430/blob/master/Practice_Tasks/Practice_02.md) starting from **step 7** BUT keep the history linear and DO NOT create merge commits. Use [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) instead of merging.

4. Reflect for yourself on the advantages and disadvantages of using `git rebase` instead of `git merge` and the linear history.
